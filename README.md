WordPress Plugin for [rfp-ads](https://github.com/mrlowe/rfp-ads/)

This plugin allows you to easily modify your WordPress site to display an advertisement for zero-percent financing with First Financial Bank. To install the plugin:

1. Download the latest release: [https://github.com/mrlowe/rfp-ads-wp/releases](https://github.com/mrlowe/rfp-ads-wp/releases).
1. Log in to your website as an adminstrator, and from the dashboard choose *Plugins | Add Plugin*.
1. Choose *Upload Plugin* and browse to the zip file you downloaded.
1. Select *Install Now*.
1. Select *Activate Plugin*.

You should now see the RFP zero-financing advertisement every time you load your home page. If you would like to show the ad less often or show 24-month instead of 12-month financing, you can change the plugin settings at *Settings | RFP Ads*.

## Settings

#### Show on Every Page
Normally the ad is only shown on your site's home page. Select this option to show the ad on every page of your website.

#### 24-Month Term
Select this option to show an advertisement for a 24-month term rather than a 12-month term.

#### Show Again after # Days
By default, the ad is shown every time a user loads your home page. Change this value to hide the ad for the given number of days. So, for example, if you enter 7 here, the ad will be shown once when the user first visits, and will not be shown again until seven days have elapsed.

#### Destination URL
If you want the user to be redirected to a different page if they click on the ad, enter the URL here.
